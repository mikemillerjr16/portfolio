              <p>
                My work sits at the point where an AI idea has to become something
                a team can actually run. I like designing RAG and agentic systems,
                and I spend most of my attention on the parts that decide whether
                they ship: grounding, guardrails, evaluation, and keeping a human
                on the decisions that count.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have built production ML systems, led a data science team, and
                spent the last stretch customer-facing. Lately I have been building
                my own AWS applications, which means I care as much about whether a
                solution gets adopted, and stays safe, as whether it works in a demo.
