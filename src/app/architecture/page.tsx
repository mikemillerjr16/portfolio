            The conversation has moved on from &ldquo;can AI do this&rdquo; to
            &ldquo;can we trust it in production.&rdquo; The hard problems now are
            grounding answers in real sources, deciding how much autonomy an agent
            should have, evaluating a system that is non-deterministic by design,
            and doing all of it without a runaway cloud bill. These are the
            patterns I keep coming back to for exactly those problems.
