    content: (
      <div className="space-y-3">
        <p>
          &ldquo;Agent&rdquo; is the exciting word, but most requests describe a
          known sequence of steps — which is a workflow, not an agent. I&apos;ll
          ask them to walk me through the task concretely. If we can enumerate the
          steps in advance, a workflow is cheaper, faster, easier to test, and
          easier to trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          An agent earns its cost only when the path can&apos;t be known ahead of
          time — when a later step genuinely depends on what an earlier step
          discovers. I&apos;d rather ship a reliable workflow now and add agentic
          behavior where a specific decision actually needs it.

    id: "weak-rag",
    question: "A RAG system is returning weak answers",
    meta: "Debugging · Retrieval",
    content: (
      <div className="space-y-3">
        <p>
          I start at retrieval, not the model. The most common cause of weak RAG
          isn&apos;t the LLM — it&apos;s that the right passage never gets
          retrieved. I&apos;d check chunking, embeddings, and whether the query
          and documents are even in the same semantic space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I&apos;d build a small labeled evaluation set so &ldquo;weak&rdquo;
          becomes measurable. Only after retrieval is solid would I look at the
          generation prompt, add re-ranking or hybrid search, or consider a
          different model. Guessing without an eval set just moves the problem
          around.

    meta: "Delivery · Governance",
    content: (
      <div className="space-y-3">
        <p>
          I&apos;d name the gap plainly: a POC proves the idea can work; production
          proves it can be operated safely. The distance between them is usually
          evaluation, monitoring, security, governance, cost at scale, and
          human-in-the-loop design — not model quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;d turn that into a concrete checklist with the customer so the
          &ldquo;last 20%&rdquo; is visible and planned, rather than a vague
          promise that it&apos;s &ldquo;almost done.&rdquo;

    meta: "Right-sizing · Cost",
    content: (
      <p>
        I&apos;d ask how the decision is actually made. If someone looks at it once
        a day, real-time infrastructure is standing cost for latency nobody uses.
        Real-time is worth it when the value of the data decays in minutes. Often
        the honest answer is that a scheduled batch job is cheaper, simpler, and
        entirely sufficient — and I&apos;d rather say so than sell complexity.

    content: (
      <p>
        Bigger isn&apos;t automatically better, and it&apos;s definitely not
        cheaper. For grounded tasks, a smaller model with good retrieval usually
        beats a larger model without it. I&apos;d match the model to the task:
        reserve the biggest models for genuinely hard reasoning, and use smaller,
        faster, cheaper ones where they meet the accuracy bar — measured, not
        assumed.

    meta: "Security · Agentic access",
    content: (
      <div className="space-y-3">
        <p>
          Good instinct, but every exposed tool is a new attack surface. I&apos;d
          scope credentials tightly, make tools least-privilege, and put an
          approval gate in front of anything destructive or irreversible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;d also treat any content that comes back from a tool as data, not
          instructions — prompt injection through tool results is a real risk. The
          goal is a secure, standards-based path to enterprise data, not a model
          with unrestricted keys.

      <p>
        This is the highest-risk situation on the list, so I&apos;d stop and fix it
        first. Without an agreed definition of success, every demo is a debate and
        the project never &ldquo;lands.&rdquo; I&apos;d work with stakeholders to
        define what good looks like and how we&apos;ll measure it — before writing
        much code — so we&apos;re building toward a target instead of toward
        opinions.
