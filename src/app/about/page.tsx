                I&apos;m {siteConfig.name}, a senior AI solutions architect and
                engineer based in the {siteConfig.location}. Most of my work now
                lives in the same place: retrieval-augmented systems, agents, and
                agentic workflows, and the guardrails, evaluation, and human
                approval that decide whether any of it is safe to put in front of
                a real customer.
              </p>
              <p>
                My path into this is a little unusual. I started by building
                things. I spent years as a data scientist and ML engineer shipping
                forecasting and optimization models into production, then led a
                data science team, and moved into a customer-facing role because I
                liked the part of the job that was about helping people make good
                technical decisions. That history is why I care less about the
                demo and more about what happens when the system meets real data,
                real latency, and a real audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lately I have been building it, not just advising on it. ResolveIQ,
                TrustResponse, and ArchIQ are live AWS applications where I worked
                through the questions that actually matter for enterprise AI: how a
                system cites its sources, when it should refuse to answer, where a
                human stays in control, and how you keep a public AI feature from
                becoming a surprise bill.

                I&apos;m a compulsive learner — I keep a running set of reference
                libraries and technical playbooks, partly because writing
                something down is how I know I actually understand it, and partly

                I genuinely enjoy teaching and explaining architecture. Some of my
                favorite moments are watching a concept click for a room of
                engineers, or helping a business leader feel confident about a
                decision they were nervous about. If I can make a hard idea feel
                approachable without hiding its complexity, I&apos;ve done my job.
